# FlameCommander

A super basic console mod for Rift Wizard. The console is accessed via
standard input and accepts any suite of python statements. The statements
are run in the context of the `RiftWizard` module.

I expect this mod works on Rift Wizard 2 as well (currently) but am unable
to test this.

## Installing

simply run `git clone https://github.com/Solonarv/FlameCommander` inside your
rift wizard mods folder.

This mod is standalone.

## Disclaimer

I banged this mod out in less than an hour. It's not pretty, it doesn't work
*well*, but it does work.
